Machine learning is a field in which algorithms learn to improve themselves based on their interactions with an environment. In this course, we explore a broad array of techniques from machine learning and statistical pattern recognition. Topics will include a mix of unsupervised learning, clustering, dimensionality reduction, supervised learning, neural networks, reinforcement learning, and learning theory. An emphasis is placed on mathematical analysis leading to computer-based implementation. Applications will be drawn from areas such as computer vision, speech recognition, autonomous navigation, natural language processing, and data mining.
